WARMUP:

1. Create a new Git/GitHub named python_fund_warmup
2. Create a file called app.py
3. Create a list of strings
4. Loop through and print out each string
5. Create a function that will accept 1 string as an argument
  5.1. This function will print out the string plus the message 'I was given this string'
6. Call the function for each string in your list of strings
7. Modify the function to now check to see if the string starts with the letter 'q'
  7.0. I wonder if there is a built in function in python that can check this
  7.1. If so, print out a message saying 'q found' plus the string
  7.2. If not, do nothing
8. Create a list of dictionaries (these are the same as JS objects)
9. For each dictionary, give the following key-value pairs:
  9.1. username (string)
  9.2. is_subscribed (boolean)
  9.3. age (number)
10. Create a function that will accept a list of dictionaries as an argument
  10.1. The function will return a new list of dictionaries.
  10.2. This list will only contain users with a is_subscribed of True
11. Add, commit and push your code
